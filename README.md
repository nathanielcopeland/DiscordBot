# CitadelBot

This Discord bot was created to help keep track of all things related to my clans citadel on the game runescape.

## What is the citadel
The citadel is a private personal area shared between members of our clan, that features a big castle in the middle of the area.

## How the citadel works

Each person in the clan can gather resources around the citadel such as wood, stone, charcoal, various ores, up to a limit of 2000 
(depends on the size of the citadel) each week.

Each week we can choose 3 buildings to progress towards upgrading, that each require different resources. for example one building might require 1980 wood and 1100 stone.

## so what does the bot do?
The bot keeps track of the time left until the citadel resets, and keeps a list of who has reached the limit of resources for the week, also called capping.

## List of commands
#### All commands must be prefixed with '!'
'capped' : Adds the person to the list of who has capped that week </br>
'r' : returns the time left until the citadel resets </br>
'cl' : returns the list of who has capped this week </br>
